# An Unweighted Undirected Graphs Algorithm Library

This repository represent a collection of algorithms on unweighted undirected graphs i.e. relationships do not have magnitude and are bidirectional.

a data structure infrastructure, algorithms and display system.
There are algorithms like duplication capability, connectivity test, shortest path calculation (minimum number of edges) and finding the shortest path.
